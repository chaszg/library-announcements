#### Interested in Open Access Publishing?
We support open access publishing in many ways:
- A [guide](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/openaccessagreements/mainpage) that summarizes open access agreements at CMU
- View the [list of all eligible journals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w1jyazVE3J3Rv5hfV-rKoZGzNfkwTX-Fj3cHyNOHyVU/edit#gid=0) covered under the CMU publisher agreements.

>[!question] Open Educational Resources
**Open Educational Resources (OER)** are free, openly licensed, and open-access teaching materials. OER reduces financial access barriers to students by lowering the costs of textbooks and course supplies, helping to make higher education more equitable and accessible. As openly licensed material, OER allows faculty to modify and enrich resources, giving faculty the ability to tailor materials to course needs that can increase student engagement. Research has shown that OER increases overall student grades and decreases DFW rates.  
>
According to [CMU’s cost of attendance](https://www.cmu.edu/admission/costs-aid/tuition-and-fees), undergraduate students are expected to budget $2,400 annually on textbooks and course supplies. Expanding OER initiatives at CMU is one way to help reduce education barriers facing our students, as well as the outside community.
>
**If interested in exploring OER options for your courses**, I invite you to meet with Emily Bongiovanni, the Open Knowledge Librarian at CMU ([ebongiov@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:ebongiov@andrew.cmu.edu)) to schedule a consultation.
>
We also welcome you to explore the [OER guide](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/OER) for a variety of resources.
>

#### Speaking of Open Educational Resources:
We are continually adding full workshop content and curricula to our [Open Data Science Workshop Page](https://cmu-lib.github.io/portfolio_workshop/).

>[!tip] Registration Open: [Three Minute Thesis (3MT)](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/register-for-3mt) Competition!
>
3MT is an internationally recognized competition that challenges Ph.D. students to present a compelling oration on their thesis and its significance in just three minutes, in language that anyone can understand. 3MT is not an exercise in trivializing or "dumbing down" research, but requires students to consolidate their ideas, crystallize their research discoveries, and capture the imagination of their audience.
>
**<u>Registration is open until Friday, January 26.</u>** Any interested PhD students should [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdxpORWzB_fVxkRdsu0T-PIwICGzuclx4k8Qhs0SSa5EEYUmw/viewform). More information can be found at the [3MT website](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/c.php?g=1164739&p=8503008).
