At the [Pople Lecture](https://events.mcs.cmu.edu/pople/) earlier this month, the actual Nobel Prize awarded to the late John Pople was on display thanks to the University Archives. That is just one exciting example of historic CMU artifacts held by the archives. Drop in and explore their collections!
