#### Interested in learning at your own pace? ‚òï
Check out full workshop content on the [Open Data Science Workshop Page](https://cmu-lib.github.io/portfolio_workshop/). We encourage instructors and students to use this content for self-guided learning.

#### Data & Code Support üìä
Book a virtual or in-person¬†[appointment](https://www.library.cmu.edu/service/data-code-support#:~:text=We%20offer%20support%20for%20all,simply%20learning%20a%20new%20skill.)¬†with a library consultant for quick help with research programming needs and open source code like R or Python.

### Registration Open: [Three Minute Thesis (3MT)](https://www.library.cmu.edu/about/news/2024-11/3MT-registration-open) Competition! üïí

3MT is an internationally recognized competition that challenges Ph.D. students to present a compelling oration on their¬†thesis¬†and its significance in just¬†three¬†minutes, in language that anyone can understand. 3MT is not an exercise in trivializing or "dumbing down" research, but requires students to consolidate their ideas, crystallize their research discoveries, and capture the imagination of their audience.

**Registration is open until Friday, January 24, 2025.** Any interested PhD students should [register here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScvMf2ZFyD8KjbXm5kfdLKRFuU_wU2sgUiseEwFxngMpVJ98A/viewform). More information can be found at the¬†[3MT website](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/c.php?g=1164739&p=8503008).

## Publishing Open Access: News and Support üîì

##### New Open Access Journal Eligibility Checker
CMU Libraries now offers OA support for 28,000 academic journals through publisher agreements and APC funds. To make it easier for authors to navigate across all of CMU‚Äôs agreements and check a journal's eligibility, we‚Äôve launched a [new journal search tool](https://search.scifree.se/cmu).

##### New Transformative Agreements
We're pleased to announce three new open access publishing agreements:

- **De Gruyter**: Covering a wide range of disciplines, from humanities to engineering.
- **Company of Biologists**: Specializing in life sciences research.
- **Scientific.net** (Trans Tech Publications Ltd): Focusing on engineering and related fields.

**CMU now offers a total of [17 open access agreements](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/OA/agreements)**, as well as two APC discount agreements. Our existing agreements include American Chemical Society, Elsevier, Wiley, Oxford University Press, Cambridge University Press, and more. We know we still have room to expand and we will continue conversations with publishers to try to fill our gaps.¬†

##### APC Funds
Articles in fully Open Access journals outside of our agreements might still be made OA with support from the Libraries' APC funds. See [CMU‚Äôs APC webpage](https://www.library.cmu.edu/services/apc-fund) for more information and to apply for APC funds.

##### Important Note on Author Eligibility
Articles must have a currently affiliated CMU corresponding author to be eligible for the OA publisher agreements and CMU Libraries APC funds. This includes students, but they still need to be a current student by the time the item is in its final publishing steps to be eligible. We have worked with publishers to add messaging to their author portals, but unfortunately continue to see OA requests being declined due to previous students listed as the corresponding author.

To learn more on publishing Open Access, view this [guide](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/OA/CMU)

## Databases and Research Guides üñ•
- Access [Databases for Chemical Engineering](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/az/databases?s=44489)
- Refer to the [Chemical Engineering Research Guide](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/c.php?g=215551&p=1421671) for other resources.
