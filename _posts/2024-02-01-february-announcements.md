>[!cmu-resource] Reproducibility Hackathon 2024
>**Join the CMU Libraries 2024 Reproducibility Hackathon: a Day in Digital Humanities**
>
>CMU Libraries is [hosting a hackathon focused on replicating and augmenting published research](https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/events/repro-hack-2024) in digital humanities from CMU.  This one-day in-person hackathon will be held at CMU Hunt Library, March 22, 2024.
>
>The hackathon is a collaborative, rather than competitive, event, with each team working with data and code produced from the same publication, to reproduce and reuse, exploring new ideas and analyses. 
>
>Applications are open to anyone from CMU and other institutions in Pittsburgh. Knowledge and awareness of scientific programming with Python and/or R is desired, but not required for participation. All findings and research outputs such as data, code, and visualization will be shared to a public repository on Open Science Framework and collectively published in an article or preprint.
>
><u>Please complete this [application](https://forms.gle/6r6kNnBMyodhLdsM6) to apply for the event.</u> Applications will close on March 1, 2024 at 11:59 PM. Contact Chasz Griego ([cgriego@andrew.cmu.edu](mailto:cgriego@andrew.cmu.edu)) with any questions.
