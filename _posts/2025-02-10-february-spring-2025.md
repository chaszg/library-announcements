## Research data support and federal data backups 🏛

The [CMU Libraries Data Services](https://www.library.cmu.edu/services-overview/data) offers robust research data support, from consulting on data management plans and best practices, providing data curation, and offering guidance on repositories. Some helpful reminders and timely updates follow.   

##### Federal data backups for your research and teaching
The US federal government collects, aggregates, and disseminates a large volume of information and data. This content is used by researchers, policymakers, and many others for various purposes. Data can potentially disappear because of government shutdowns, broken links, and policy shifts.

The CMU Libraries has a [checklist](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/researchdatamanagement/backingup_federal_data) on backing up federal data you may need for your research and teaching. This checklist provides steps you can take to ensure the government data you use in your research and teaching remains accessible to you and others.

Many federal data backup efforts are underway, including the newly launched [Data.gov Archive](http://data.gov). The [Data Services team](https://www.library.cmu.edu/services-overview/data) will be curating and maintaining a list of resources for accessing preserved federal data. 

##### Tools to support you across the research data lifecycle
The Libraries provides various tools and resources to support faculty and student research data management and sharing. We offer [open workshops](https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/workshops) on these tools, and are always happy to provide on-demand workshops or consultations. 

- [Open Science Framework](https://www.library.cmu.edu/node/2235/)  – manage research data and projects, share work with collaborators, and register research with this cloud-based platform
- [Protocols.io](https://www.library.cmu.edu/node/2232/)  – document and share step-by-step methods and protocols
- [LabArchives](https://www.library.cmu.edu/node/2234/)  – securely record and share research notes and data in an Electronic Research Notebook
- [KiltHub Repository](https://www.library.cmu.edu/node/2274/)  – make all of the products of your research openly available and citable with CMU’s institutional repository
- [DMPtool](https://dmptool.org/) – an online resource for creating data management plans that meet funding agency requirements and promote your research

##### Text & Data Mining Resources Guide
Visit our [Text and Data Mining (TDM) Resources Guide](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/TDM_ResourcesGuide) for comprehensive guidance on utilizing and engaging with the Libraries' available resources, including their respective data use policies.
##### Tartan Research Data Alliance
In fall 2024 we kicked off our first [Tartan Research Data Alliance](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/dataalliance) cohort. The Tartan Research Data Alliance brings together graduate students, post-docs, early career researchers, and research support staff interested in developing their research data skill sets and serving as data lifecycle liaisons to their departments and labs. TRDA participants learn about funder requirements, open science principles, and best practices in managing data across the research lifecycle while participating in a cohort that provides peer mentorship and community.

The call for the next cohort will be announced in spring 2025. [Sign up to be first in the know](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeaZHENC-1VSvGYhdtFmASA2HfC-O62KnEAZN6PExsoDUsUYA/viewform).
