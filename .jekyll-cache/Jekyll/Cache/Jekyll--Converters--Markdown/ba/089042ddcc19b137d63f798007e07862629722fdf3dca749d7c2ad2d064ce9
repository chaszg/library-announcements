I"Z<p>Good morning,</p>

<p>I hope you all have had a nice fresh start to the fall semester. My name is Chasz Griego, and I’m the new Science and Engineering Liaison Librarian, serving the Chemistry department along with Chemical Engineering and Materials Science and Engineering. My background is in Chemical Engineering, having recently finished my PhD from Pitt. I am very excited to help support this community!</p>

<p><strong>How I can help</strong>: I am here to help you at any stage of the research lifecycle, whether it’s knowledge discovery or management, experimental planning, data collection, analysis, collaboration, or dissemination. For specific subject matter, I have expertise in the fields of catalysis, computational chemistry and materials science (simulations with density functional theory), general data science and machine learning approaches, Python programming, Jupyter Notebooks, and Open Science practices related to reproducibility with data and code.</p>

<p><strong>How to reach me:</strong> I am happy to have consultations with anyone that has questions or needs assistance. You can send me an email (cgriego@andrew.cmu.edu) or schedule an appointment with me <a href="https://cmu.libcal.com/appointments/cgriego">here</a>. My office is 4410 in Sorrells Library (4th floor Wean Hall). If I’m in my office, feel free to knock on my door!</p>

<p>In general, the libraries have a lot to offer! Here is a brief list of resources, services, and events that I think you might be interested in.</p>

<p><strong>Databases and Research Guides</strong>: We have access to many databases and tools on this <a href="https://guides.library.cmu.edu/az.php">list</a>, and you can refer to this research guide ()()()()()()()()()()()()()()() for many other resources.</p>

<p><strong>Workshops</strong>: Here is a brief list of workshops. You can view the full list <a href="https://cmu.libcal.com/calendar/events/?cid=9148&amp;t=d&amp;d=0000-00-00&amp;cal=9148&amp;inc=0">here</a>.</p>
